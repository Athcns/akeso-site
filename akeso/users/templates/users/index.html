                <p>Akeso was created in mind for people. It started off as a simple diary people could access with the web but then grew into more allowing people to document their feelings with provided feedback. If you've ever wanted to write a diary or atleast take a few minutes of your day to write how your day went then Akeso is a place for you. It's a simple to use diary site that has no fees hidden behind it and features are not masked behind subscriptions.<br><br>Akeso was originally a personal project started during COVID-19 times where people's moods were low. It was a time where my mind also began to break down and my mood was getting worse. Motivation was low and times were tough since the freedom we once had was so limited; however, I took up meditation and self improvement in order to counter that. I discovered the possibilities of mental health and how much of a difference it can make to work on them. One of the big methods I used was writing in my own personal diary. After some time writing in it and writing my own thoughts, I thought that I could make one online for others to use. From that thought Akeso was born.&nbsp;</p>
